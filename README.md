# Renting car app demo

React-Redux app demo for renting cars between a selected date range.

It is made of a server API that provides car bookings, and a front-end that allows to check availability.

## Install and run

First, start server API:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Second, start the front-end:

```bash
cd .. // Root directory of the project
npm install
npm start
```

Now, browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and voil√†!

## How to use it

When first loaded (no dates in date selectors) the booking lists represent the whole list of bookings in database.

If you select a start date and a end date, then the app will show you how many cars we hava available, and the bookings for that same date range.

## TO-DO

These are some things I'd like to implement:

- Validate: start date cannot be above end date.
- Format: if no cars are available, show the alert in red instead of green.
- Feature: save the searched booking in DB.
- Feature: select which type of car you'd like.
- Feature: delete bookings.
- Refactor: unit testing and BDD.
